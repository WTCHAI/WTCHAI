- Style new Ux Ui design by using tailwind Css
- Boarding pass rendering .I think , I could do it but I have to reading for final test . 
    - Boarding pass need new data structure and also in input form ( more flight Details , new input of timeStamp having individal date 00/00/00 and time 12:00 or when arrived just use only flight details ,name and timeStamp . All of these depends on designing dataflow and uxui since the first place)
