# Challenge

#### Style new Ux Ui design by using tailwind Css

#### Boarding pass rendering 

    I think , I could do it but I have to reading for incoming final test . 
        Boarding pass need new data structure and also input form
        - More flight Details
        - Config more props , funciton , interface and data structure to using and passing data each detial to boarding pass 
        - New input of timeStamp (having individal date 00/00/00 and time 12:00) 
        - Try changing Departure and Arrived log form by using flight details(A0137) instead of airport , passengerName and timeStamp.
        
    And all of these above depend on what design of ui and data flow of this web application at the first place .
